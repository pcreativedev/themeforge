## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Gallery: card view with thumbnails.** Toggle between dense list
  and 220×190 cards with project thumbnails (200×120). Thumbnails are
  cached at `~/.cache/themeforge/thumbnails/<slug>.png` and generated
  either from screenshots captured with 📸 or as branded placeholders
  (vertical gradient with stack colour + project initials).
- **Gallery: custom tags per project.** Edit with **🏷️ Tags…**.
  Stored in `~/.config/themeforge/projects-meta.json`. Filter the
  gallery with `tag:<name>` in the search bar (chainable:
  `tag:venta tag:aurora`).
- **Gallery: last AI session indicator.** Each project row shows the
  time since the latest Claude Code conversation, by inspecting
  `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/*.jsonl` mtimes.
- **Gallery: project archive.** Move projects to
  `~/Proyectos/themes-archive/` with **📦 Archivar**, reversible via
  **↩️ Restaurar**. Toggle **📦 Archivados** to switch views.
- **Command palette (Ctrl+K).** Spotlight-style fuzzy-finder over
  tabs, projects (active + archived), and quick actions. Multi-word
  queries, positional scoring, keyboard-only navigation.
- **🔬 Pre-flight checker.** Toolbar button in ProjectWindow that
  runs 13 automated checks against ThemeForest requirements + best
  practices: README, LICENSE, documentation/, screenshots/, jQuery
  legacy, Bootstrap legacy, hardcoded tracking, prefers-reduced-motion,
  .env tracked in git, project size + large files, unresolved scaffold
  placeholders, lighthouse / html-validate availability. Results grouped
  by severity with actionable hints.
- **📦 Marketplace ZIP builder.** Toolbar button in ProjectWindow that
  packages the project ready for upload to ThemeForest / CodeCanyon /
  Gumroad / Creative Market. Excludes node_modules, .git, .next, dist,
  .env, .cache, .vscode, .claude, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md,
  *.log, .DS_Store, vendor, target, etc. Dialog opt-in for
  documentation/, screenshots/, source/. Output:
  `~/Proyectos/themes-builds/<slug>-<ts>.zip`.
- **Plugin system.** User-defined plugins at
  `~/.config/themeforge/plugins/*.py` can register custom stacks,
  template types and AI agents without forking. Files starting with
  `_` are ignored (convention for disabled). Examples shipped in
  `examples/plugins/`.
- **💰 AI cost tracker.** New main-window tab "Coste IA" that scans
  local AI session stores (`~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl` for Claude
  Code, `~/.codex/logs_2.sqlite` for Codex) and reports cost / tokens
  by provider, model, project and day. Three QtCharts visualizations
  (donut by provider, horizontal bar for top 10 projects, stacked bar
  for last 30 days) with consistent provider colors, dark theme,
  animations, native tooltips. Pricing hard-coded for common Claude
  3.x/4.x, GPT-5.x, o3 and Gemini 2.x models in `cost_tracker.PRICING`;
  unknown models fall back to Opus rates marked with ⚠. No external
  API calls — entirely local.
- **🚀 Demo deploy.** Toolbar button in ProjectWindow that builds
  the project and deploys to **Netlify**, **Vercel**, **Cloudflare
  Pages** or **Surge.sh**, then copies the public URL to the clipboard
  and offers to open it in the browser. Auto-detects build command and
  dist directory for Next.js, Astro, Vite, SvelteKit, Gatsby, Nuxt,
  CRA, Angular, Hugo, Jekyll and plain HTML; user can override both in
  the dialog. CLI availability check with install hint, build → deploy
  chain runs in QProcess (UI remains responsive), logs streamed live to
  the project log panel.
- **📦 Multi-format Linux distribution.** GitHub Actions workflow
  `.github/workflows/build-linux.yml` builds three Linux artifacts
  from a single PyInstaller bundle on every tagged release:
  AppImage (universal), `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) and `.rpm`
  (Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE) — all via `fpm`. PKGBUILDs for AUR
  (`packaging/aur/themeforge` stable + `themeforge-git` git tip)
  to publish to the Arch User Repository. Local build script:
  `scripts/build-linux-appimage.sh`.
- **🖥️ Cross-platform refactor + macOS alpha.** New
  `platform_compat.py` module centralises every OS-specific call
  (file manager, terminal launcher, shell exec, VS Code launcher,
  config/cache dirs). All previously-Linux-only call sites
  (`bash -lc`, `konsole`, `dolphin`, `xdg-open`) now dispatch by OS.
  GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml`
  builds a `.app` bundle on every tagged release using a
  GitHub-hosted `macos-latest` runner — no Apple Developer ID
  required for distribution as alpha (Gatekeeper warning expected
  on first launch). Local build script: `scripts/build-macos.sh`.
- **🎨 App icon + desktop launcher.** ThemeForge ships an app icon in
  `assets/themeforge.png` (anvil + hammer + code/screens — branded for
  the project) plus pre-rendered sizes (16/32/48/64/128/256). The icon
  is loaded at startup and propagates to titlebar / taskbar / alt-tab
  / dock. A `scripts/install-desktop-entry.sh` script installs a
  user-local `.desktop` entry so ThemeForge shows up in the DE app
  menu (run with `--uninstall` to remove).
- **🤝 Multi-agent compare.** New main-window tab that runs the same
  prompt across multiple AI CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode)
  in parallel and displays the outputs side-by-side in resizable panes.
  Each agent shows live status (idle → running → done/error), TTFT
  (time-to-first-token) and total wall time. Agents not installed are
  shown disabled with the install hint. Per-pane **📋 Copiar** action
  copies the output to clipboard. Useful for: choosing the best agent
  for a task, debugging which model has the right take on a problem,
  or generating multiple competing solutions for a manual merge.
- Initial public release of ThemeForge.
- GUI builder (PyQt6) for scaffolding template projects across 60+
  stacks (Next.js, Astro, Laravel, WordPress, Shopify, Flutter, Tauri,
  Spring, Ktor, Phaser, R3F, …).
- Four creation modes: scratch, recreate-from-reference, adopt-local,
  existing-GitHub-repo.
- Conversational reference analysis dialog with multi-turn history,
  streaming, TTFT/token/cost metrics, and CLAUDE.md injection.
- Per-project window with embedded multi-tab preview, embedded
  terminal (xterm.js + node-pty), live dev-server logs, GitHub
  push/create with `.gitignore` sanitisation.
- Pixel Office visualizer integration (auto-install + auto-launch +
  embedded tab) using a fork of `neomatrix25/pixel-office-openclaw`
  (MIT) with Claude Code session reader added.
- Optional licensing system scaffolding for Next.js, Laravel,
  WordPress and Express stacks (verify-license route, setup wizard,
  middleware) driven by a configurable verify endpoint.
- Settings panel with diagnostic info, AI provider key management,
  Pixel Office install/launch/stop, default stack picker.
- Comprehensive English user guide (`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`) + styled
  HTML version (`docs/user-guide.html`) generated from the Markdown.
- AI agent support: Claude Code, Codex (OpenAI), Gemini (Google),
  OpenCode (with OpenRouter).
- Multi-stack mono-repo detection with sub-project dropdown.
- Stderr secret redactor (sk-…, gho_…, AIza…, glpat-…) so AI keys
  never reach the log panel.
- Context override system: `~/.config/themeforge/context-private/`
  takes precedence over the repo's `context/` so per-user private
  research / strategy can be injected into every project without
  touching the repo.
