# Trademarks

ThemeForge is an independent open-source project published under GPL v3
by the **pcreativedev** team. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by,
sponsored by, or otherwise connected to** any of the third-party
products, brands, or marketplaces it references for integration.

This file lists the third-party marks referenced in ThemeForge source
code, documentation, scaffold templates, and prompts, and clarifies the
basis on which they are used.

## Basis of use

All third-party trademarks are used here strictly under the doctrine of
**nominative fair use**: the marks identify the corresponding products
so users and developers know which product ThemeForge integrates with
or analyses. Specifically:

- Only the wordmark / name is used. **No logos** of third-party products
  are reproduced anywhere in this repository.
- Usage is **factual and descriptive** (e.g., *"WordPress (Elementor
  Child Theme)"*, *"installs Bricks parent theme if declared in
  `wp_packs.json`"*, *"compatible with Divi"*).
- ThemeForge does **not** suggest sponsorship, partnership, certification,
  or any commercial relationship with the trademark owners.
- ThemeForge does **not** bundle, redistribute, modify, or sublicense any
  of the products listed below. Where auto-installation is offered, the
  product is downloaded from its **official source** (WordPress.org plugin
  repository, the project's own GitHub releases, or — for premium items —
  from a path supplied by the end user in a local config file).
