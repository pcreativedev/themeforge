# ThemeForge — User Guide

A GUI builder (PyQt6) for scaffolding modern template projects that you
can sell on marketplaces like ThemeForest, CodeCanyon, Creative Market
and Gumroad — driven end-to-end by AI coding agents (Claude Code,
Codex, Gemini, OpenCode).

This guide covers installation, first-time setup, the project creation
workflow, advanced features (multi-stack mono-repo support, embedded
preview, conversational reference analysis, GitHub integration, pixel-
art session visualizer), configuration files, the optional licensing
system, and troubleshooting.

## 1. What is ThemeForge

ThemeForge is a PyQt6 desktop application that automates the boring
parts of starting a new template project:

- Scaffolds 60+ modern stacks (Next.js, Astro, Laravel, WordPress
  themes/plugins, Shopify, Flutter, Tauri, Spring, Ktor, Phaser, R3F…)
  with up-to-date defaults and security patches.
- Drops a CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md context file in the project so any AI
  coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode) understands the
  goals and constraints from the first message.
- Provides modes for scratch, recreate-from-reference, adopt-local
  and existing-GitHub-repo workflows.
- Lets you analyse a reference template **interactively** with the AI
  agent — including stack recommendation, market research and
  reimplementation plan — and inject the analysis into the project's
  CLAUDE.md.
- Opens a per-project window with embedded preview (multi-tab
  browser), embedded terminal (xterm.js + node-pty), live logs and a
  one-click GitHub push/create flow.
- Optionally integrates your own licensing system (verify endpoint +
  setup wizard + admin panel hooks) into every theme generated.
- Optionally shows your active AI sessions as pixel-art avatars in a
  virtual office (via the bundled `pixel-office` visualizer).

ThemeForge does **not** generate the actual code of your templates —
the AI agent does. ThemeForge prepares the ground so the agent starts
with maximum context and minimum boilerplate.

## 2. System requirements

| Component | Minimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Linux (Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro / EndeavourOS recommended) | Tested on KDE Plasma 6 Wayland. Should work on GNOME and other DEs. |
| Python | 3.11+ | For PyQt6 type hints. |
| PyQt6 | 6.6+ | Includes `PyQt6.QtWebEngineWidgets` for the embedded browser. |
| Node.js | 20+ | For the embedded terminal server, AI CLIs, and most stack scaffolds. |
| npm | latest | Bundled with Node. |
| Git | 2.40+ | For repo operations. |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`) | optional | Needed only if you want the "📦 GitHub" button to create/update repos. |
| Docker | optional | Required for stacks that use `docker-compose` or `wp-env` (WordPress). |
| Composer + PHP 8.3+ | optional | Required for Laravel / WordPress stacks. |

For the AI agents you'll want at least one of:

- `claude` (Claude Code CLI, Apache 2.0)
- `codex` (OpenAI Codex CLI, Apache 2.0)
- `gemini` (Google Gemini CLI, Apache 2.0)
- `opencode` (OpenCode CLI)

All four are invoked as external processes; ThemeForge does not bundle
them. Install whichever you plan to use.

---

## 3. Installation

ThemeForge is currently distributed as a Python project that you clone
and run with `launch.sh`. No PyPI package yet.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/themeforge.git
cd themeforge

# Python dependencies — only PyQt6 needs to be installed.
# On Arch / CachyOS:
sudo pacman -S --needed python python-pyqt6 python-pyqt6-webengine

# On Debian / Ubuntu:
sudo apt install python3 python3-pyqt6 python3-pyqt6.qtwebengine

# Build the embedded terminal server (Node).
cd terminal
npm install
cd ..

# Launch
./launch.sh
```

Alternative: KDE menu entry. After cloning, copy or symlink
`themeforge.desktop` into `~/.local/share/applications/` (you'll need
to create it manually pointing at your `launch.sh` location).

---

## 4. Initial setup

The first time you launch ThemeForge, it creates `~/.config/themeforge/`
with:

```
~/.config/themeforge/
├── favorites.json          # bookmarked stacks (empty initially)
├── ports.json              # per-project port assignments
└── (you create the rest)
```

Optional files you can add to extend ThemeForge to your workflow:

- `~/.config/themeforge/keys.json` — API keys for AI providers
  (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter). Permissions are auto-set to
  `0600`. The Settings panel offers a UI to populate this.
- `~/.config/themeforge/licensing.json` — URL of your own license
  verification endpoint, admin panel base, GitHub org, Java/Kotlin
  package ID. See §16.
- `~/.config/themeforge/known-product-slugs.txt` — one slug per line of
  your own product catalogue, used to auto-tick the "🔑 Activar
  sistema de licencias" checkbox when you start a new project with a
  matching name.
- `~/.config/themeforge/context-private/*.md` — your private versions
  of the context docs (market research, competitor analysis, licensing
  spec) that get injected into each new project's CLAUDE.md. See §16.

None of these are required for basic use.

---

## 5. Quickstart — your first project

1. Launch ThemeForge.
2. In the main form:
   - **Nombre** (Name): `My First Template`
   - **Stack**: click the button and pick *Next.js + Tailwind* (the
     default).
   - **Tipo** (Type): pick the category, e.g. *SaaS Landing*.
   - **Provider**: pick the AI agent you have installed (e.g. Claude).
   - **Modo** (Mode): leave on *Desde cero* (scratch).
3. Click **Crear proyecto y lanzar agente**.

What happens behind the scenes:

1. ThemeForge creates `~/Proyectos/themes/my-first-template/`.
2. Runs the Next.js scaffolder (`npx create-next-app@latest …`).
3. Copies the context MDs (`context/*.md`) into the project.
4. Generates `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md` depending on provider) with:
   project metadata, market analysis, the template type, requirements
   from `REQUIREMENTS-THEMEFOREST.md`, your private context overrides
   if any (see §16).
5. Runs `npx autoskills -a claude` to install relevant skills for the
   stack (skips silently if `autoskills` is not installed; see §18).
6. `git init` + initial commit.
7. Opens the **ProjectWindow** with the embedded preview, terminal,
   logs and the AI agent ready to chat in a tab.

In the project window:

- The terminal tab on the right has the AI agent already loaded.
- Type something like *"Read CLAUDE.md and tell me what you understand
  before changing anything"* to confirm the agent has the full
  context.
- When you're happy, click **▶ Start preview** to launch the dev
  server in the embedded browser.

---

## 6. Project creation modes

### Desde cero (scratch)

Pure greenfield. Runs the stack scaffolder and gives you a clean
project. Best for new ideas that don't reference any existing template.

### Recrear referencia (recreate-from-reference)

You point ThemeForge at a folder, ZIP, or URL that contains the
"reference" template. ThemeForge:

1. Runs the stack scaffolder.
2. Drops the reference contents in `reference/` (added to `.gitignore`).
3. Sets up the CLAUDE.md so the AI agent treats `reference/` as
   read-only inspiration material, NOT as code to copy.

Use this when you want to build *your own* implementation of an idea
seen in a competitor template. The CLAUDE.md generated includes
strict anti-copy rules so the agent reimplements every line from
scratch with your branding.

This mode pairs with the **🔍 Analizar referencia con IA** button
(see §9) which produces a written analysis of the reference (market,
stack, gaps, plan) that gets injected into CLAUDE.md.

### Adoptar template local (adopt)

You already have a template in a folder and want to work on it
in-place with the ThemeForge workflow. ThemeForge:

1. Copies the contents of your local folder into
   `~/Proyectos/themes/<slug>/`.
2. Adds the context MDs and CLAUDE.md on top, so the agent inherits
   the ThemeForge conventions without altering your existing code.
3. Detects mono-repos automatically and gives you a sub-project
   selector in the ProjectWindow.

### Trabajar sobre repo existente (existing)

You point at a GitHub repo (`owner/name`). ThemeForge:

1. `gh repo clone owner/name <slug>`.
2. Detects the stack from the repo contents.
3. Adds the context MDs + CLAUDE.md.
4. Opens the ProjectWindow.

This is best when you want to continue an existing project under the
ThemeForge umbrella — same preview/terminal/agent UI as new projects.

---

## 7. Supported stacks

The full list lives in `stacks.py`. As of the current version, 60+
stacks are supported including (non-exhaustive):

- **Web frontend**: Next.js (Tailwind / shadcn / Mantine / HeroUI),
  Astro (Tailwind / shadcn), Remix, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Qwik,
  SolidStart, React-Vite, Vue 3-Vite, Angular, plain HTML+Tailwind /
  Bootstrap.
- **Frontend libraries**: Storybook (React).
- **CMS**: WordPress Block Theme (theme.json + MCP-adapter), WordPress
  Plugin (with abilities API), Payload CMS, Strapi, Medusa, Sanity
  Studio, Directus, Docusaurus, VitePress, Starlight, Hugo, Eleventy.
- **Backend**: Hono (Bun / Cloudflare), NestJS + Prisma, FastAPI,
  Django + Tailwind, Phoenix LiveView, Rails + Tailwind, Bun-Elysia,
  Deno-Fresh, Spring Boot, Ktor, Go-Fiber, Rust-Axum.
- **Full-stack**: T3 Stack, Laravel + Inertia + Tailwind.
- **Mobile**: Flutter, Expo / React Native (NativeWind / Expo Router),
  Ionic + Capacitor, Kotlin + Compose.
- **Desktop**: Tauri (React), Electron (React).
- **Game-dev** (Vite + TypeScript): Phaser, PixiJS, React Three Fiber.
- **Email templates**: react-email.
- **Browser extensions**: Plasmo, WXT.
- **Shopify**: Liquid (Dawn theme).

Each stack has:
- A `scaffold` command list run via bash.
- A `skills` list (Anthropic / Vercel / WordPress / Shopify skill
  packages auto-installed by `npx autoskills`).
- A `preview` profile (the dev-server command + port).
- A `notes` string with stack-specific gotchas surfaced in the UI.

To add a new stack, see `stacks.py` — append a dict to the `STACKS`
constant. Pull requests welcome.

## 8. AI providers

ThemeForge invokes external AI agent CLIs as subprocesses. Supported:

| Provider | CLI binary | API key env var | License of CLI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude (Anthropic) | `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Apache 2.0 |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` (via `codex login --with-api-key`) | Apache 2.0 |
| Gemini (Google) | `gemini` | Google OAuth or `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Apache 2.0 |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (for OpenRouter models) | Apache 2.0 |

### Setting API keys

Open the Settings panel (gear icon) and use the provider picker. Keys
are stored in `~/.config/themeforge/keys.json` with `chmod 0600`. The
directory is `0700`.

Keys are never logged. The UI shows only `set` / `unset`, never the
value. They are passed to the AI agent subprocess via
`QProcessEnvironment`. As an extra defense, the stderr panel of the
reference-analysis dialog redacts `sk-…`, `sk-ant-…`, `sk-proj-…`,
`sk-or-v1-…`, `AIza…`, `gho_…`, `ghp_…`, `glpat-…` patterns before
showing them.

### Skills auto-install (`autoskills`)

If the **npx autoskills** checkbox is on (default), ThemeForge runs
`npx autoskills -a <provider>` after scaffolding to install the
provider-specific skills declared by the stack. Skills are official
packages from Anthropic / Vercel / WordPress / Shopify referenced by
slug; ThemeForge doesn't redistribute them.

`autoskills` itself is by **midudev**
(<https://github.com/midudev/autoskills>) under **CC BY-NC 4.0**. See
§18 for the implication and how to disable in commercial builds.

---

## 9. Reference analysis (conversational)

In `recrear` or `adopt` mode, the form shows a **🔍 Analizar
referencia con IA** button (and **🔍 Analizar con IA** for adopt).

When clicked, ThemeForge:

1. Scans the reference folder/zip with `reference_analyzer.py`:
   detects build-system markers (package.json, composer.json,
   pubspec.yaml, artisan…), recognises commercial-marketplace
   structures (`codecanyon-*` folder name, `Documentation/` /
   `Files/` / `Updates/` dirs, README mentioning Envato or purchase
   codes), and detects multi-stack mono-repos to depth 3.
2. Builds a prompt with the detected facts and either:
   - The **reference prompt** (anti-copy rules — for commercial
     templates that you'll reimplement in your own code), or
   - The **design-export prompt** (when the reference looks like an
     export from claude.ai/design, v0.dev or Figma Make — assumes
     it's your own design).
   The classifier is conservative: any marketplace marker
   (CodeCanyon / ThemeForest / Envato / commercial folder structure)
   forces the reference prompt with explicit "license is out of
   scope" framing.
3. Launches the selected AI provider with the prompt via the
   ReferenceAnalysisDialog. Streams the response, tracks tokens,
   TTFT and cost in real time (for stream-json capable CLIs like
   `claude --output-format=stream-json`).
4. When the turn ends, the **reply input** below the output enables.
   Type a follow-up and press **➡ Enviar respuesta**: ThemeForge
   builds a multi-turn prompt that includes the original prompt +
   full conversation history + your new reply, and relaunches the
   CLI. Each turn is appended to the same panel with visual
   separators (`👤 Tú:` and `🤖 Agente:`).
5. When you click **💾 Guardar y cerrar**, the full conversation is
   stored as the analysis, and gets injected into the project's
   CLAUDE.md when you click **Crear proyecto y lanzar agente**.

This is the killer feature: the project's AI agent starts already
aware of your detailed analysis of the reference (stack recommendation,
market research, gaps, your specific follow-ups). The agent confirms
what it understood before changing any code.

---

## 10. ProjectWindow features

Opening any project (newly created or via the Galería tab) gives you
a per-project window with:

```
┌────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
│  Tabs of embedded preview  │  Tabs of embedded terminals │
│  - Preview (default)       │  - Setup / Shell           │
│  - + (additional pages)    │  - Claude / Codex / Gemini │
│                            │  - 🎮 Office (visualizer)  │
├────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┤
│ Logs of the dev server (live tail)                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Preview tabs

The preview panel is a `QTabWidget` of `QWebEngineView`s. The first
tab ("Preview") is bound to the project's dev server. Click the **+**
button to add additional tabs (e.g. one for the landing, one for
`/wp-admin`, one for `/docs`).

- The URL bar is shared across tabs; pressing Enter navigates the
  active tab. The ↻ reload button also targets the active tab.
- Tab titles auto-update from the page's `<title>`.
- The first tab cannot be closed (it's the dev server preview).
- The 🚀 button opens the active URL in your external browser in
  `--app` mode (Brave / Chromium / Firefox) — useful for sustained
  performance on Wayland where QWebEngine can lag.
- 📸 captures a screenshot of the active tab to PNG.
- 🔧 opens a Chromium DevTools window on the active tab.

### Viewport presets

Buttons to clip the preview width to common breakpoints (360, iPhone
14, Tablet, 1280, 1920, Full). Useful for responsive QA without
opening a separate browser.

### Multi-stack mono-repo

If the project root has more than one stack (e.g. `Files/Laravel/`,
`Files/Flutter/Driver/`), a **Sub-proyecto** dropdown appears at the
top. Switching it changes the active preview profile, port and dev
server commands. Each sub-project gets its own port assigned in
`~/.config/themeforge/ports.json`.

### Terminal tabs

Backed by an embedded Node server (`terminal/server.js`) using
xterm.js + node-pty. On startup, ThemeForge spawns the server on a
random port and creates the configured tabs:

- **Setup** (if the project just scaffolded) — runs the setup script
  and leaves a shell.
- **Shell** — plain bash in the project root.
- **<AI Provider>** — runs your chosen agent CLI (`claude`, `codex`,
  `gemini`, `opencode`) in the project root.

You can switch tabs while the AI is running; each is an independent
PTY.

### ▶ Start preview / ■ Stop

Runs the stack's preview profile. For **detached** profiles (wp-env,
`docker compose up -d`), Stop remains enabled after Start exits with
code 0 because the containers are still up — Stop will invoke the
`stop` command of the profile (e.g. `npx @wordpress/env stop`).

### Dev server logs

The bottom pane is a live tail of stdout/stderr from the dev server.
Useful for catching compile errors without leaving ThemeForge.

### 🔬 Pre-flight checker

Toolbar button that runs a battery of automated checks against the
project to verify it's ready for marketplace upload (Envato, Gumroad,
Creative Market, etc.). Fast — filesystem + grep only, no external
tools required by default.

Checks (13 total, grouped by severity):

| Check | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| README presente | `README.md` / `README.txt` exists in root |
| LICENSE / licensing.txt | Required by Envato; recommended elsewhere |
| documentation/ HTML | `documentation/index.html` present (required by Envato) |
| screenshots/ | Folder with PNG/JPG captures; ≥3 recommended |
| Sin jQuery 1.x/2.x legacy | greps for `jquery-1.*`, `jquery-2.*` references |
| Sin Bootstrap 3/4 | greps for legacy Bootstrap versions |
| Sin tracking hardcoded | greps for GA, FB Pixel, Hotjar IDs |
| prefers-reduced-motion respetado | CSS includes the media query |
| .env fuera de git | `git ls-files` shows no `.env*` tracked (except `.env.example`) |
| Tamaño del proyecto | Total <50 MB ideal, lists files >10 MB |
| Placeholders del scaffold sustituidos | greps for `__SLUG__`, `__PROJECT__`, `YOUR_DOMAIN`, `__LICENSE_API_URL__`, etc. |
| Lighthouse instalado | Info-only: hints `npm i -g lighthouse` if missing |
| HTML validator | Info-only: hints `npm i -g html-validate` if missing |

Result dialog shows each check with pass / warn / fail / info icons,
ordered by severity (fail at top). Each item expands to show the
actionable hint ("how to fix") and details (e.g. list of files where a
problem was found).

Header verdict:

- **✓ Listo para empaquetar y subir.** — zero fails, zero warns.
- **⚠ Sin fallos críticos pero hay warnings…** — proceed but consider
  fixing the warns.
- **✗ N fallos bloqueantes…** — must resolve before upload (likely
  causes marketplace rejection).

Typical flow before publishing:

1. ProjectWindow → **🔬 Pre-flight** → review warns/fails.
2. Fix what each hint suggests.
3. Re-run → all green.
4. **📦 ZIP** (next section) → upload.

### 📦 Marketplace ZIP builder

Toolbar button that packages the project into a ZIP ready for upload
to any marketplace. Excludes development noise aggressively.

Auto-excluded directories: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`,
`out/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.cache/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `venv/`,
`.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `coverage/`, `.turbo/`,
`.vercel/`, `.netlify/`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`,
`.claude/`, `.aider/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `.gradle/`, `.dart_tool/`.

Auto-excluded files: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`,
`.env.production`, `.env.test`, `.env.<anything>`, `.DS_Store`,
`Thumbs.db`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `MEMORY.md`,
`.eslintcache`.

Auto-excluded suffixes: `*.log`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`,
`*.bak`, `*.tmp`.

Dialog options (auto-detects which folders exist and pre-checks them):

- ✓ Include `documentation/`
- ✓ Include `screenshots/`
- ✓ Include `source/` (PSDs, Figma exports, editable assets)

Output: `~/Proyectos/themes-builds/<slug>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.zip`. The
ZIP wraps content in a `<slug>/` root directory — standard marketplace
convention so unzipping doesn't pollute the buyer's cwd.

After build, popup shows:

- File count + uncompressed size + compressed size + compression ratio.
- Option to open the builds folder in your file manager.

Compression: `ZIP_DEFLATED` level 6 (good balance speed/size).
Typical ratio: 50-70% reduction for text-heavy themes.

### 🚀 Demo deploy

Toolbar button that builds the project and deploys to a public host
so you can share a working preview URL with a client, reviewer or
prospective buyer.

**Supported targets:**

| Provider | CLI | Auth required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Netlify** | `netlify-cli` (`npm i -g netlify-cli`) | First time: opens browser for OAuth | Best static-site experience, edge functions if needed |
| **Vercel** | `vercel` (`npm i -g vercel`) | First time: opens browser for OAuth | Inspects the repo and picks its own dist; ideal for Next.js |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | `npx wrangler` (no install) | First time: opens browser for OAuth | Generous free tier, global edge |
| **Surge.sh** | `surge` (`npm i -g surge`) | First time: email/password prompt | Fast, anon-friendly for quick demos |

**Stack auto-detection** (from `package.json` deps + config files):

| Stack | Build command | Dist directory |
|---|---|---|
| Next.js (w/ `output: 'export'`) | `npm run build` | `out/` |
| Next.js (default) | `npm run build` | `.next/` (Vercel only) |
| Astro / Vite | `npm run build` | `dist/` |
| SvelteKit + adapter-static | `npm run build` | `build/` |
| Gatsby | `npm run build` | `public/` |
| Create React App | `npm run build` | `build/` |
| Angular | `npm run build` | `dist/` (verify `angular.json`) |
| Nuxt | `npm run generate` | `.output/public/` |
| Hugo | `hugo --minify` | `public/` |
| Jekyll | `bundle exec jekyll build` | `_site/` |
| Plain HTML | (none) | `./` |

The dialog pre-fills both fields with the detected values — you can
override them manually for stacks not in the table or for non-default
configurations.

**Flow:**

1. Click **🚀 Demo** in the project toolbar.
2. Pick a provider (default = first available CLI on PATH).
3. Confirm or edit build command + dist directory.
4. Hit **🚀 Build & Deploy**. UI shows live build logs, then live
   deploy logs (streamed via QProcess, so the app stays responsive).
5. On success: a popup shows the deployed URL, copies it to your
   clipboard, and offers to open it in your default browser.

**Server-rendered stacks** (Laravel, WordPress, Express, Rails…) are
NOT supported by this deploy — they need a Node/PHP/Ruby runtime that
static hosts don't provide. For those, use the **📦 ZIP** + manual FTP
or a server provider (Render, Railway, Fly.io, etc.).

**Auth troubleshooting:** Most providers open the browser the first
time. If you're using ThemeForge over SSH or in a headless setup,
the deploy will fail with an auth error. Run the CLI's `login` command
in a real terminal first:

```bash
netlify login
vercel login
npx wrangler login
surge login
```

---

## 11. Gallery and productivity shortcuts

The **Galería** tab lists every project ever created in
`~/Proyectos/themes/` plus archived projects in
`~/Proyectos/themes-archive/`. Each row shows: name, stack, last
modified, git status, CLAUDE.md presence, last AI session, tags.

### Tags

Each project can have one or more user-defined tags (lowercase, no
`#`). Tags help organise large catalogues by status (`borrador`,
`venta-activa`, `archivado-2025`), client (`cliente-x`), or stack
(`aurora-*`).

Edit tags with the **🏷️ Tags…** button — input is comma- or space-
separated. Tags are normalised: lowercased, deduplicated, sorted.

To filter the gallery by tag, type `tag:<name>` in the search bar:

```
tag:venta-gumroad           # only projects tagged 'venta-gumroad'
tag:venta tag:aurora        # must have BOTH tags
aurora tag:venta            # matches 'aurora' in name/stack AND tagged 'venta'
```

Tags persist in `~/.config/themeforge/projects-meta.json` (JSON, one
entry per slug).

### Last AI session

Each project row shows the time since the last Claude Code session
(e.g. `🤖 hace 2h`, `🤖 hace 3 d`, `🤖 sin sesiones`). ThemeForge
inspects `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/*.jsonl` and reports the
most recent file mtime.

This helps locate the "I was working on this yesterday" project
without remembering its name.

### Archive

Projects you're not actively working on can be moved to an archive
without deleting them.

- **📦 Archivar** button on a selected project → moves it to
  `~/Proyectos/themes-archive/<slug>/`. Confirms before moving.
- Toggle **📦 Archivados** (checkbox in filter row) → switches the
  gallery view to show archived projects only.
- In archive view, the action button changes to **↩️ Restaurar** —
  click it to move the project back to `~/Proyectos/themes/<slug>/`.

Archive is fully reversible. Conflicts (e.g. a project named `foo`
already exists in archive) raise a clear error without overwriting.

### Card view with thumbnails

Toggle **🖼️ Cards** / **📋 Lista** in the filter row switches between
the two view modes. State persists between sessions.

- **Lista** (default): dense rows with full metadata. Good for
  searching across many projects.
- **🖼️ Cards**: 220×190 cards in a responsive grid with a thumbnail
  (200×120). Visual recognition is faster.

Thumbnails are stored at `~/.cache/themeforge/thumbnails/<slug>.png`.

Sources of thumbnails (in priority order):

1. **Cached screenshot**: every time you click 📸 in a ProjectWindow,
   a 200×120 crop is saved as the project's thumbnail.
2. **Generated placeholder**: if no real thumbnail exists, ThemeForge
   draws one with QPainter — vertical gradient using the stack's
   brand colour (60+ stacks mapped) + project initials centred + stack
   name at the bottom. Looks clean even with zero captures.

To capture a real thumbnail for a project:

1. Open the project, **▶ Start preview**, wait for the dev server.
2. Click **📸** on the preview toolbar.
3. The screenshot is saved both to `screenshots/preview-<ts>.png` and
   as the gallery thumbnail.

### Command palette (Ctrl+K)

Press **Ctrl+K** from anywhere in the ThemeForge main window to open
a spotlight-style command palette. Fuzzy-finder over:

- **Navigation**: jump to any tab (Nuevo proyecto, Galería,
  licencias, Settings).
- **Projects**: open any active or archived project directly in a
  ProjectWindow without scrolling the gallery.
- **Actions**: new project, refresh gallery, switch to cards/lista
  view, jump to settings.

The palette regenerates the action list on each open, so newly
created or archived projects show up immediately.

Keyboard:

- `↑↓` navigate, `Enter` execute, `Esc` close.
- Type multiple words: `aurora laravel` matches items containing both.

The matching algorithm is substring with positional scoring: items
where the query appears earlier in the label rank higher; an exact
prefix match wins over a mid-string match.

### Other gallery actions

- **★ Favorito** — toggle. Filter to favourites-only with the **Solo
  favoritos ★** checkbox.
- **🔄 Regenerar contexto** — re-creates `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`
  for the selected project with the latest context MDs.
- **🗑️ Eliminar** — permanent delete (project dir + Postgres
  container + ports.json entry + favourites entry). Irreversible —
  requires confirmation with typed project name.
- **VSCode**, **Codex**, **Claude Code** — open the selected project
  with the chosen tool.
- **Abrir carpeta** — opens the project dir in Dolphin / Nautilus /
  whatever file manager is installed.

## 12. AI cost tracker

The **💰 Coste IA** tab in the main window aggregates token usage
and cost across every AI provider's local session store and renders
three QtCharts visualizations + detail tables.

### Scanners

| Provider | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/*.jsonl` (`message.usage` + `message.model` per `type:assistant` event) | Fully supported, robust parsing |
| **Codex (OpenAI)** | `~/.codex/logs_2.sqlite` table `logs` — `feedback_log_body` strings parsed with regex looking for embedded JSON `response.usage` | Best-effort. May miss events depending on log format |
| **Gemini (Google)** | n/a — gemini-cli does not persist token data in a documented local format | "Not supported" — link to Google AI Studio billing |
| **OpenCode** | n/a — likewise | "Not supported" — link to OpenRouter activity |

Each provider's scanner is registered in `cost_tracker.SCANNERS`; the
panel calls them in parallel, aggregates the results into one
`AggregateReport` and feeds the charts/tables.

### Pricing

Pricing per 1M tokens is hard-coded in `cost_tracker.PRICING` for the
common Claude 3.x/4.x, GPT-5.x, o3 and Gemini 2.x model IDs. Each
event's cost is computed as:

```
cost = (input_tokens          / 1M) × price_input
     + (output_tokens         / 1M) × price_output
     + (cache_creation_tokens / 1M) × price_cache_write
     + (cache_read_tokens     / 1M) × price_cache_read
```

For models not in `PRICING`, the panel uses conservative defaults
(Opus rates) and marks the row with **⚠ default** in the "Tarifa"
column so you can see the number is an estimate.

Two known sources of divergence vs the official billing dashboards:

1. **Ephemeral 1-hour cache** has higher rates than the standard 5-min
   cache (~2× cache write). `PRICING` uses the 5-min rates.
2. **`[1m]` long-context variants** of Opus may have different
   pricing tiers depending on the API tier — not modelled.

For relative breakdowns (which project / model burns the most), the
tracker is reliable. For exact billing reconciliation, cross-check
with the provider's official dashboard.

### Charts

| Chart | Type | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **🍩 Donut by provider** | `QPieSeries` with 45% hole | Slice per provider with `<provider> $<amount> (<percent>%)`. Colors are consistent across charts (claude → blue, codex → green, gemini → amber, opencode → purple). |
| **📊 Top 10 projects** | `QHorizontalBarSeries` | Project paths decoded from Claude's encoded format (`-home-uther-Proyectos-themes-foo` → `~/Proyectos/themes/foo`), top 10 by cost, labels formatted `$amount`. |
| **📅 Last 30 days stacked** | `QStackedBarSeries` | One bar per day for the last 30 days, segmented by provider with consistent colors. Hover tooltips show exact values. |

All three charts use the dark theme with transparent background,
series animations on refresh, and native hover tooltips. They scale
with the window — resize the ThemeForge window to enlarge them.

### Filter

The combo at the top filters to a single provider:

- **Todos los proveedores** (default): aggregate across all known
  scanners.
- `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`: focus on one provider. The
  donut becomes a single-slice (less useful) but the daily chart and
  top projects refocus to that provider only.

Click **↻ Re-escanear** to re-read the session stores after using the
AI agents — the tracker doesn't auto-refresh while you work.

### Detail tables

Below the charts:

- **Por modelo (top 10)** — table with cost, events, tokens in/out,
  and tariff status (`✓ conocida` / `⚠ default`).
- **Por proveedor** — same data the donut shows but in tabular form
  with scanner notes (file paths scanned, event counts).
- **Por proyecto (detalle)** — same data as the top-10 horizontal bar
  but with full path and event counts.

### Privacy

The cost tracker reads ONLY local files in your home (`~/.claude/`,
`~/.codex/`). It does NOT contact any provider's API; pricing is
embedded constants. Your token data never leaves your machine.

---

## 13. Multi-agent compare

The **🤝 Comparar** tab in the main window runs the same prompt
across multiple AI CLIs in parallel and displays the outputs
side-by-side in resizable panes.

### Supported agents

| Agent | CLI | Invocation |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude` | `claude -p "<prompt>"` |
| Codex | `codex` | `codex exec "<prompt>"` |
| Gemini | `gemini` | `gemini -p "<prompt>"` |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `opencode run "<prompt>"` |

Agents whose CLI is not on PATH are shown disabled with the label
`<agent> (no instalado)`. Each agent has a consistent color across the
ThemeForge UI (claude blue, codex green, gemini amber, opencode purple).

### Flow

1. Open the **🤝 Comparar** tab.
2. Type the prompt in the textarea (anything from a one-liner to a
   multi-paragraph spec works).
3. Check the agents to run (defaults to all available).
4. Click **▶ Ejecutar**.
5. One pane per agent appears side-by-side, each streaming output as
   the CLI produces it. Stats line shows live status, TTFT
   (time-to-first-token) and total wall time.
6. Click **📋 Copiar** in any pane to copy that agent's output to
   the clipboard.
7. **■ Cancelar** kills all running processes; **🧹 Limpiar** clears
   the panes.

### Metrics shown per pane

- **⏳ idle** — pane created, process not started.
- **▶ corriendo…** — process started, waiting for first output.
- **⏱ TTFT 1.2s · corriendo…** — first output received at 1.2s, still streaming.
- **✅ TTFT 1.2s · total 8.4s** — finished successfully.
- **❌ exit 1 · 3.2s** — process failed (auth missing, prompt too long, etc.).
- **■ cancelado** — user clicked Cancel.

### Cost considerations

This tab does *not* track cost — each invocation runs in the CLI's
default account (OAuth for Pro/Max accounts, or API key if `--bare`
mode is configured). To see the cost of these runs, switch to the
**💰 Coste IA** tab and click **↻ Re-escanear** — the local session
stores get updated by each CLI invocation.

### Limitations (MVP)

- No per-agent model picker (uses each CLI's default model). For
  Claude that's the OAuth default; for Codex it's gpt-5-codex-pro
  (depending on the plan).
- No token / cost extraction (planned — see ROADMAP).
- No diff view between agents' outputs (planned).
- No "vote-merge" composite (planned).
- Server-rendered streaming responses are shown as plain text — any
  agent-specific formatting/markdown is preserved verbatim.

### Use cases

- **Choose the best agent for a task.** Different models excel at
  different domains (Claude on long-form code review, Codex on tight
  code edits, etc.) — compare empirically.
- **Debug an unclear specification.** Run the same prompt on N agents
  and check whether they all converge on the same interpretation. If
  they diverge, your prompt is ambiguous.
- **Generate competing solutions for manual merge.** Get 2-3 distinct
  approaches and cherry-pick the best parts.

---

## 14. GitHub integration

The **📦 GitHub** button in the project toolbar discovers existing
repos and offers update-or-create.

When clicked:

1. Verifies `gh` is installed and authenticated. If not, prompts to
   install via paru/apt and run `gh auth login`.
2. Calls `gh repo list` for your active user AND for the
   organisation listed in `~/.config/themeforge/licensing.json`
   (`github_org` field) if configured. Filters by repos whose name
   matches the project folder name (case-insensitive).
3. Shows a dialog with:
   - `↻ Actualizar  <owner>/<slug>  [public/private]` — for each
     match found.
   - `＋ CREAR nuevo  <your-gh-user>/<slug>  [privado]`.
   - `＋ CREAR nuevo  <github_org>/<slug>  [privado, org]` if
     `github_org` is set.
4. Once you pick an option:
   - **Sanitises the index**: ensures `.gitignore` blocks
     `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.env*`,
     `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `.idea/`,
     `.vscode/`, `.DS_Store`. If any of these were accidentally
     committed before, runs `git rm --cached` to untrack them, then
     creates a tidy-up commit.
   - **Updates existing**: sets `origin` to the chosen repo (if it
     doesn't match), then `git push -u origin HEAD`.
   - **Creates new**: `gh repo create <slug> --private --source=.
     --remote=origin --push`.
5. Logs the URL on success, shows a popup with the link.

## 15. Pixel Office visualizer

Optional. Visualises your active AI agent sessions as pixel-art
avatars in a virtual office, served as a web dashboard on
`localhost:3002`.

ThemeForge integrates with the MIT-licensed fork at
`pcreativedev/pixel-office-openclaw` (based on
`neomatrix25/pixel-office-openclaw`), with an additional reader for
Claude Code sessions added to its `server.js`.

### First run

The first time ThemeForge launches, if it doesn't find Pixel Office
installed, it asks:

> Pixel Office no está instalado. ¿Instalar ahora? (clones the repo
> to `~/.local/share/themeforge/pixel-office-openclaw/`, runs npm
> install + npm run build. Takes ~1-2 min.)

If you accept, ThemeForge installs and auto-launches `node server.js`
in background. The dashboard is then embedded in every
ProjectWindow's "🎮 Office" tab.

### How the Claude Code reader works

The server scans `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` files (where Claude
Code stores its conversations). For each `.jsonl` younger than the
active-window threshold (default 60 minutes):

- The file mtime → `lastActivity`.
- The first `{"type": "ai-title", ...}` line found → `name`.
- The `model` field of the last assistant message → `model`.
- The last user or assistant message → `lastMessage`.

These are exposed at `/sessions_list` in the same schema as OpenClaw
sessions. The React frontend renders one avatar per agent (project),
with status `active` / `waiting` / `idle` based on recency.

### Disable

Settings → 🎮 Office → ■ Stop. Or set
`PIXEL_OFFICE_NO_CLAUDE_CODE=1` to scan only OpenClaw, or pass
`--no-claude-code` to the CLI binary.

---

## 16. Settings panel

The Settings tab in the main window exposes:

- **AI providers**: API key configuration per provider (see §8).
- **Default stack**: select the stack used as the form default.
- **Postgres provisioning**: auto-spin a per-project Docker postgres
  container when scaffolding stacks that need a DB (Next + Drizzle,
  Laravel + Postgres, etc.).
- **🎮 Office**: install / launch / stop / open the Pixel Office
  dashboard.

---

## 17. Optional licensing system

> **TL;DR — what's bundled and what isn't.**
>
> ThemeForge ships the **client side** of a license verification flow:
> setup wizard UI, middleware guard, and a small HTTP client that
> calls your verification endpoint with a documented request/response
> schema. ThemeForge does **NOT** ship the backend (the verify endpoint,
> the license database, the admin panel, the Gumroad/Stripe webhook).
> You bring your own, or you point the client at a third-party service
> (Lemon Squeezy License API, Polar, Paddle, Gumroad License Verify…)
> with a tiny adapter. If you don't sell themes with license keys at
> all, leave the checkbox off and nothing licensing-related is added
> to the project.

ThemeForge can scaffold a **license verification client** into every
new theme — useful if you sell on Gumroad / your own web store and
want each downloaded theme to verify the purchase code before
running.

Activation: check **🔑 Activar sistema de licencias** in the project
creation form. Optional sub-checkboxes:

- **└─ Crear repo gh `<your-org>/<slug>` (Phase 3)**: at end of
  scaffolding, runs `gh repo create` under your org.
- **└─ Forzar también en modos `adopt` / `existing`**: by default the
  scaffold only runs in `scratch` and `recreate` modes to avoid
  collisions; tick this if you want to overlay the licensing files on
  a template that doesn't have them yet.

The checkbox is auto-ticked if the project name matches one of the
slugs in `~/.config/themeforge/known-product-slugs.txt`.

### What gets dropped per stack family

| Stack family | Files generated |
|---|---|
| Next.js | `src/app/api/verify-license/route.ts`, `src/app/setup/page.tsx`, `src/store/setup-store.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `.env.example` additions, `npm install zustand` |
| Laravel | `app/Http/Controllers/SetupWizardController.php`, `CheckSetupWizard.php` middleware, `SetupState.php` model, dated migration, Blade view with Alpine wizard, `routes/web.php` and `bootstrap/app.php` patches (idempotent), `.env.example` additions |
| WordPress (plugin/theme) | `inc/class-license.php`, `inc/admin-license-page.php`, `README.licensing.md` |
| Express / Hono / NestJS / Bun-Elysia | `src/routes/license.ts` (stub), `.env.example` additions |
| Other stacks | A note in the project README pointing to `context/LICENSING-SYSTEM.md` for manual integration |

### URL templating

The verify-license URL, the panel base URL, and other host-specific
values are NOT hardcoded in the templates. They use placeholders
(`__LICENSE_API_URL__`, `__LICENSE_HOST__`, `__LICENSE_HOST_BARE__`,
`__ORG_ID__`) which `licensing_scaffold.py` substitutes at scaffold
time from `~/.config/themeforge/licensing.json`. If the config file
doesn't exist, placeholders (e.g. `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/...`) are
emitted instead.

### Bring your own backend

The PHP backend is not required to be a specific implementation. As
long as your endpoint accepts:

```http
POST /api/license/verify
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "license_key": "XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-WWWW",
  "product":     "<product-slug>",
  "domain":      "buyer-host.com",
  "action":      "activate",
  "version":     "1.2.3"
}
```

…and returns:

```json
{
  "valid":   true,
  "type":    "regular|pro|extended|developer",
  "email":   "buyer@example.com",
  "expires": "",
  "uses":    1,
  "max":     1,
  "product": "<product-slug>",
  "server_time": 1735689600
}
```

…the scaffolded clients (Next.js / Laravel / WordPress / Express) will
work. Drop-in compatible backends: Lemon Squeezy License API, Polar,
Paddle MoR, Gumroad license verify, or your own PHP/Node endpoint.

---

## 18. Configuration files

Under `~/.config/themeforge/`:

| File | Purpose | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `favorites.json` | Bookmarked stacks in the picker. | 0644 |
| `ports.json` | Per-project (and per-sub-project for mono-repos) port assignments. | 0644 |
| `projects-meta.json` | Per-project tags (`{"slug": {"tags": [...]}}`). See §11. | 0644 |
| `keys.json` | AI provider API keys. **Sensitive.** | 0600 |
| `licensing.json` | URLs, GitHub org, package ID for the optional licensing system. **Sensitive (URLs may be private).** | 0600 |
| `known-product-slugs.txt` | Your product catalogue, one slug per line. Used to auto-tick the licensing checkbox. | 0644 |
| `context-private/*.md` | Your private versions of context MDs (market research, competitor analysis, licensing spec). Overrides the public stubs in `context/`. | 0644 |

ThemeForge also persists state outside `~/.config/`:

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/Proyectos/themes/` | All active projects you've created with ThemeForge. |
| `~/Proyectos/themes-archive/` | Projects archived from the gallery (§11). Reversible. |
| `~/Proyectos/themes-builds/` | Marketplace ZIPs produced by **📦 ZIP** in ProjectWindow (§10). |
| `~/.cache/themeforge/thumbnails/<slug>.png` | Card-view thumbnails for the gallery (200×120). Generated from screenshots or as placeholders. Safe to delete — they regenerate. |
| `~/.local/share/themeforge/pixel-office-openclaw/` | Auto-installed Pixel Office visualizer (§13). |

### Context override pattern

When ThemeForge generates a new project, it copies context MDs to
`<project>/context/`. Discovery is dynamic:

1. Each `*.md` under `~/.config/themeforge/context-private/`.
2. Each `*.md` and `*.template.md` under `<repo>/context/` whose stem
   doesn't already exist in (1).

Templates have a `.template.md` suffix; their `.template` is stripped
on copy. This means you can ship public neutral stubs in the repo
(`MARKET-RESEARCH.template.md`) while injecting your real research
(`~/.config/themeforge/context-private/MARKET-RESEARCH.md`) into every
project you build locally.

The public stubs in `context/` are intentionally neutral — no product
names, no domains, no strategies leak from the repo.

---

## 19. Troubleshooting

### ThemeForge does not start (ImportError on PyQt6)

Install `python-pyqt6` and `python-pyqt6-webengine` from your distro.
On Arch: `sudo pacman -S python-pyqt6 python-pyqt6-webengine`. On
Debian: `sudo apt install python3-pyqt6 python3-pyqt6.qtwebengine`.

### Embedded terminal does not load

The terminal needs Node. Verify:

```bash
which node
node --version          # must be 20+
cd terminal && npm install
```

If still broken, look at the `[term-server stderr]` lines in the
project window's bottom log pane.

### Embedded preview shows blank in Wayland

QtWebEngine has known performance issues on some Wayland setups. Use
the 🚀 button to open the preview in Brave/Chromium in `--app` mode
instead. The native browser handles the page natively.

### "🎮 Pixel Office no está instalado" but I already installed it

The auto-detect checks two paths:

```
~/.local/share/themeforge/pixel-office-openclaw/
~/Proyectos/pixel-office-openclaw/
```

If you cloned elsewhere, either move it or symlink one of the above
to your install location.

### Project shows the "Connect to OpenClaw" gateway screen

ThemeForge's `pixel_office.py` serves the SPA at `localhost:3002`. The
SPA auto-connects to same-origin if `/sessions_list` responds. If the
gateway screen appears anyway, reload (Ctrl+R). If it persists, clear
browser cache for `localhost:3002`.

### `wp-env start` exits with `Error: No plugins activated`

A previous version of ThemeForge's wp-env config injected a buggy
`afterStart` hook. Open the `.wp-env.json` in your WordPress project
and delete the entire `lifecycleScripts` block — wp-env auto-activates
plugins listed in `plugins`. ThemeForge no longer emits the broken
hook for new projects.

### `start preview` succeeds but Stop is greyed out

For detached profiles (wp-env, `docker compose -d`), the start command
exits with code 0 after launching containers. Recent ThemeForge keeps
Stop enabled when the profile defines a `stop` command. Make sure
you're on the latest commit.

### `📦 GitHub` says "No estás autenticado en gh"

Run `gh auth login` in any terminal and complete the flow. ThemeForge
will pick up the auth on the next click. The OAuth token lives in
`~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` (managed by gh, NOT touched by ThemeForge).

### Brave / Chromium does not detect as installed

ThemeForge looks for one of: `brave`, `brave-browser`, `chromium`,
`google-chrome-stable`, `google-chrome`, `microsoft-edge`, `vivaldi`,
`firefox`, `xdg-open`. If none are found, the 🚀 button errors out.

### NTFS USB or disk won't mount

Install `ntfs-3g`. On Arch: `sudo pacman -S ntfs-3g`. CachyOS's
linux-cachyos kernel doesn't include the `ntfs3` in-kernel module by
default; `ntfs-3g` provides FUSE-based access.

### Reference-analysis dialog says "Need login" for Gemini

Gemini requires Google OAuth via `gemini` CLI's first-run flow OR a
`GEMINI_API_KEY` env var. Run `gemini` once in a terminal to complete
OAuth, or set the key via the Settings panel.

## Appendix A — Directory layout of a generated project

After ThemeForge creates a project, the on-disk layout looks like
this (for a Next.js + licensing example):

```
~/Proyectos/themes/my-template/
├── .git/
├── .gitignore
├── CLAUDE.md                    # injected by ThemeForge
├── README.md                    # from the stack scaffolder
├── context/                     # market/competitors/requirements MDs
│   ├── REQUIREMENTS-THEMEFOREST.md
│   ├── MARKET-RESEARCH.md       # private if you have ~/.config/.../context-private/
│   └── …
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   │   └── verify-license/route.ts   # licensing scaffold
│   │   ├── setup/
│   │   │   └── page.tsx                  # licensing wizard
│   │   └── …
│   └── store/
│       └── setup-store.ts                # Zustand store for setup
├── middleware.ts                # redirects to /setup if not completed
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

For multi-stack mono-repos (e.g. Laravel + Flutter), each stack lives
in its own subdirectory and the sub-project dropdown lets you switch
the active preview between them.

## Appendix B — Reporting issues

If you hit a bug:

1. Check §17 (Troubleshooting) first.
2. Run ThemeForge from a terminal so you can capture stack traces:
   `python3 ~/Proyectos/themeforge/themeforge.py`.
3. Report at the repo's Issues tracker including:
   - Distro + kernel (`uname -a`).
   - Python version, PyQt6 version (`pip show pyqt6`).
   - Node version.
   - Stack you were creating.
   - Mode (scratch / recreate / adopt / existing).
   - The traceback.
